# FlowerPress üå∏

A **Substack/Notion-style cloud editor for markdown-based [data-rich documents](https://datarichdocuments.com/) and datasets** compatible with [Flowershow.app](https://flowershow.app).

* Primary focus: making it effortless to curate and publish datasets and associated commentary.  
* Medium-term vision: a **general-purpose editor for markdown-based rich documents**, which can include datasets, tables, charts, and other content.

### Core UX Principles

* **Markdown-first**: every page is persisted as a markdown file.  
* **Seamless media handling**:  
  * Drop in an image ‚Üí stored as a separate file ‚Üí embedded in the markdown.  
  * Drop in a CSV/Excel file ‚Üí stored separately ‚Üí embedded as a live preview (table/graph).  
  * Drop in links or screenshots ‚Üí directly embedded.  
* **Canvas experience**: Notion-like block editor, but output is markdown \+ linked assets.  
* **Zero-friction workflow**: as simple as GitHub README \+ Issues, but with Substack-level smoothness.

## Document/Data Structure

* **One markdown document (the ‚Äúreadme‚Äù)** per dataset or data-rich page.  
* **Associated assets**:  
  * Images ‚Üí stored alongside, referenced in markdown.  
  * Data files (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.) ‚Üí stored alongside, embedded in markdown via preview.  
* **Backend structure**:

```
dataset-name/
  README.md
  data.csv
  chart.png
  screenshot.jpg
```

* **Frontend rendering**: previews, charts, and tables auto-generated for embeds, while markdown provides narrative/context.

# References & Inspirations

* [**DataHub.io**](http://DataHub.io) **/ Evidence.dev etc** ‚Üí markdown-driven data storytelling, embedding SQL \+ charts.  
* **ObservableHQ.com** ‚Üí interactive data notebooks, rich embedding of visualizations.  
* **Substack** ‚Üí frictionless publishing flow for blogs/newsletters.  
* **Notion / BlockNote / TipTap** ‚Üí block-based editors with markdown persistence.

# Appendix: Value Proposition for Data Publishing

## 1. Problem

Publishing datasets today is either:

* **Clunky**: GitHub repos/Issues ‚Üí powerful but slow, not optimized for quick narrative \+ dataset publishing.  
* **Closed**: Platforms like Statista or ObservableHQ lock content into proprietary silos.  
* **Fragile**: Datasets disappear (URL rot, companies acquired/pivot, etc.).

**Need**: A *fast, markdown-native way* to curate and publish data-rich documents that combine narrative (markdown), data (CSV), and visuals (images/tables).

## 2. Solution

‚ÄúFlowerpress‚Äù provides a **Substack/Notion-style editor** that outputs **markdown + linked assets**, making it effortless to:

* Write a **narrative (markdown README)**.  
* Drop in **images ‚Üí auto-upload \+ embed**.  
* Drop in **CSV files ‚Üí auto-upload \+ embed preview as a table (and later charts)**.  
* Publish instantly, with elegant SEO-friendly output (via DataHub or Flowershow)

## DataHub.io and Flowershow: how FlowerPress fits into the existing ecosystem

Already have a markdown-based data / content publishing platform (DataHub.io and Flowershow) but lack an editor to easily create the markdown-based documents / repos that get published there.

* Want to make it easier for (me and team) to **curate and publish datasets quickly and informally**, with the ability to refine/improve over time.  
  * üö© Right now I end up dumping things in github issues because it is quick and dirty.   
* Flowershow already provides a markdown-based publishing pipeline that drives [DataHub.io](http://DataHub.io)  
* Flowerpress is the complementary **editor** that streamline dataset publishing.
